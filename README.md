# Ascii Video Player

A simple script that turns .mp4 files into ASCII characters

This is a modified version inspired by PtitGnou.

Original Code: https://github.com/PtitGnou/AsciiVideoCPP

## How to run

In order to use the script you should have the `.mp4` file in the same folder and when asked in the promt write the name of the files without the `.mp4`.
For example if the file is "video.mp4" you just need to write "video".

## Requirements

* OpenCV 4.2
* C++17 or newer
